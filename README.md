C&I Group 5 Capstone Project Getting Lost (In Nature) A website that finds walking trails within a given area for the user to then explore. It will be using the Google Maps API to accomplish this. This will also allow users to save these trails for future reference. If time permits, the website will provide statistics on the trail. These statistics will be things such as distance, elevation change and other relevant information to provide an idea of difficulty. The website allows users to search for walking trails based on their location or a searched location in a specific region. The user can then look for specific trails in their region or in a specific region they are looking for. They can specify the details they are looking for like the length of the trail, the elevation, estimated time of completion, etc. Trails can als be viewed from a map to get a better view. Lastly, users can save trails for future reference while also saving the time of completion.
